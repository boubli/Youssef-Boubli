Utilization of VEBP in the hospitality sector

Improved Organizational Communication

Not all businesses have a single-location unit and not all staff members are available under one roof. Most establishments in the hospitality domain have a multinational and even inter-continental presence. Phones and emails cannot always address global communication needs. Smart workplace communication technologies can not only connect dispersed staffs, conduct remote program monitoring, be a medium for in-house staff meetings but also be instrumental for enhanced customer experience based on service efficiency. Live streaming of inauguration events, award ceremonies is also an added benefit of video enabled enterprise -level collaboration.

Upgraded Customer Service

Customers are the biggest deciding factors who can make a business thrive. The word-of-mouth propaganda is more effective than any other form of advertisement. Unsatisfied customers are often more vocal and can adversely affect the revenue.

High esteemed celebrity and VIP guest generally like to be catered exclusively. The video enabled customer care solution can also utilize to provide a virtual care executive who will be exclusively catering to the needs of the celebrity guests. The guests can directly contact the executive from their tabs, mobiles or laptops to have their requirements met within minimum possible time.

Effortless Internal Training

The importance of internal training in the hospitality sector cannot be overstated. The chief function of the workers in this sector is to serve people and aim guest satisfaction. Without proper training, the employee-customer interaction may get off the track and affect the bottom line. For example, there might be a sudden rise in the customer complaint about the quality of the food served or the management wants to introduce a new cuisine range. This stimulates the need for enrolling the chefs into a special culinary class. A video enabled learning management system (VLMS) can help the employees join the virtual training sessions from anywhere, without spending any extra hours at work. Even the remote teams can join the training sessions without shifting bases.
