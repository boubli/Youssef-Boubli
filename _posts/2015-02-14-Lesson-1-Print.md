#Lesson requirements
	1- If you are a Windows user, you must install Python-2.6.4 and can download it from Python.org. Linux distribution users are automatically installed with the system.
	2 - Read the Python language lesson catalog

# Print 
We can print the output on the screen without the print command, but using this command the output will be formatted to be free of some extra symbols such as the quotation mark.

# Examples
Type any word between quotation marks without using the print command in the IDLE Python GUI program and press Enter

```python
	>>> ‘Youssef Boubli’

```

output is :
```python
	‘Youssef Boubli’
```

samething with "print" 
output is :
```python
	Youssef Boubli
```

If we want to print numerical outputs, we do not need to type them between quotation marks
Example of printing numerical outputs
```python
	>>> print 2009
```
output is :
```python
	2009
```

So we may know print in Python.
Our next lesson will be about the values and Variables and use them with the print command.
