There is widespread discontent among the professors, following the correspondence of the Regional Director of the Ministry of National Education to the educational inspectors, directors and directors of the educational institutions on the follow-up of the continuous monitoring procedure, drawing the current academic year 2018/2019.

For me, because I have an expert in this area, the site works every year but the number of visitors increases when the approach of the point of this is pressure, but why the officials did not think in order to put an end to this problem for the server he is using `Departement de l'Education Nationale rabat`.

The site was programmed in weak programming languages because the servers are not good and asp language you need powerful servers for better and faster work but unfortunately as mentioned by Morocco needs to strengthen the information system
