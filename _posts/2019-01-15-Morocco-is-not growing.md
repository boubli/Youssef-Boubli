Some indicators say that Morocco is growing and that it is the best AfricanSome indicators say that Morocco is growing and that it is the best African and Arab country. But this is not true.

It is nonsense. In my opinion, the country that does not manufacture is not growing.It is approaching growth. Morocco is a peasant country but it has problems and poverty in agriculture. And the lack of mechanization in the agricultural sector.

But despite these circumstances, Morocco can progress on many Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia and the Arab countries. In terms of technology, we have the potential to work hard for Morocco. <strong>Unfortunately,</strong> Morocco does not provide anything for this marginalized group and Arab country, but this is not true

As we can see in the picture above, the technology index is high compared to the Arab countries, but unfortunately we need support for this category. Moral support through the provision of services and schools to learn and create awareness campaigns for the advancement of the digital world in Morocco.
