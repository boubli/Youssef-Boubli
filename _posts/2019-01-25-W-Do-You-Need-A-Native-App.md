Companies build mobile applications to give a tough challenge to their competitors in order to win consumers' interest. Mobile applications open up opportunities to people. Business persons can easily find a way to start their own business. A market research helps them understand the areas that remain untapped before in the commerce. Mobile applications, today, are hugely used in the e-commerce where a small industry gets a platform to showcase and sell their products. After considering fields to be explored, companies need to resolve the confusion of choosing the right mobile app development.

# Mobile App Development Categorization:

Developers have three ways to design a mobile application. Native apps are those that are platform or device specific. Since these applications concentrate on devices, they have advantages to access the feature of the operating system and other software supports of devices. Companies are also showing interest in developing hybrid applications that support multi-platform and are based on single-code designing. Hybrid applications are easier to develop. The vest interesting and demanded mobile apps are web apps. They run on browsers and they perform requests over the internet. You no need to download such applications.

So, these mobile apps have come up with both advantages and disadvantages. Choosing the right one is still necessary for any business. Even though hybrid and web applications outperform native apps in respect of benefits, companies stick to the native designing option for offering a great user experience.

# Why do you need native applications?

Consumers want a great user interface from your application. It does not matter to them which approaches you have adopted. They need a smooth navigation and all the features that help them easily find out their product. Native applications fulfill all requirements rightly. These apps are fast and reliable. When you want to offer a seamless app experience to your users, you need these applications.

Hybrid applications, though easier to design, perform poorly and have a low user experience. Since these apps load data directly from the server, some key problems arise. The number of server requests definitely affects the functioning of an app. There is also a problem regarding the load balance requests.

The biggest reason for having a native application is the user experience. Since people want a smooth integration between mobile apps and devices, this option comes first to the mind.

# Benefits of Native App:

You have many reasons to go with these applications. Companies that have apps designed for a specific operating system have earned uncountable benefits. These apps not only boost the traffic, but they also make your approach trust-worthy and reliable.

# Development:

Since native applications are platform-centric, you will get many versions that offer a smooth function. Your user will be happy to download your app when you have many things to offer.

Accessing device's inbuilt features:

When an app integrates well with the devices' feature, it gives a satisfying result. Native applications use GPS, calendar, camera, and other functions of a device to give users a quality experience.

# Speed:

No other mobile applications can be as fast as native apps. Since hybrid apps are dependent on browsers, they take time to load. This cannot be the case for native apps. They are independent and work brilliantly on a device.

# Offline functioning:

Native applications give you an offline support. You can run your applications with or without internet connectivity. Since these apps download data, users can work offline.

There are many factors that contribute in choosing a mobile app development type. According to the marketers, more companies choose native applications for their benefits. Since these apps need time to develop, companies must wait for more than 6 months. Those who want a quick launch to grab the early market prefer hybrid apps to others. But, some issues like user experience and an easy navigation always play a role in making an app successful.

Native applications seem to be mandatory for a few business fields, such as messenger, game, social app, complex planner, and an online shopping with a payment option. If you are dealing with one of these options, choose a high-quality app development. Web or hybrid applications have also some specific areas to use, such as a dictionary, newspaper or magazine, and an online catalog.

Identify your target audience first and design applications for users. Native Android app developers find a great demand as the reach of the operating system is higher than any other OS. But, if your business targets a global audience, try to design iOS applications that bring you a better result.
