Over a amount of your time, computers became an important a part of businesses. Installation of computers, their support and maintenance square measure services all organizations need. As businesses grow, the amount of computers within the organization additionally increase. It becomes imperative to determine a scientific thanks to connect these computers in order that they operate in an exceedingly hassle-free manner. Therefore, computers square measure interconnected in numerous ways in which. this can be the idea of a network.

# What is a laptop network?

A network are often understood as variety of computers connected along to share resources. the foremost common resource shared is that the web. different resources are often printers, file servers, etc. The computers within the network could also be connected through AN coax or wirelessly through radio waves. 
Now {we will|we'll|we square measure going to} see however the individual computers in an exceedingly network are connected: 
Computers connected in an exceedingly network square measure remarked as nodes.

Star Topology:

In this case, there's a central node from that connections square measure provided to individual computers. during this case, albeit there's any drawback with a specific cable, the opposite computers will still operate undisturbed. On the flipside, this sort of affiliation needs heaps of cabling.

# Bus Topology:

In this case, all the computers square measure connected by one cable. the knowledge that's supposed for the last laptop must travel through all the nodes. The chief profit is that it needs lowest cabling. However, if there's any fault within the cable, all the computers square measure affected.

Ring Topology:

In this topology, all the computers square measure connected through one cable. the tip nodes also are connected to every different. The signal circulates through the network to achieve the supposed recipient. In case, a network node is organized incorrectly or there's another issue, the signal can build varied makes an attempt to search out the supposed recipient.

# Collapsed Ring Topology:

In this case, the central node could be a network device called the hub, router or switch. This device runs in an exceedingly ring that includes plugins for cables. And, every laptop is severally connected to the device through individual cables.

Each organization chooses its own topology of the pc network to confirm a efficient functioning of their computers. Once the computers square measure connected, offices even have separate cabling closets, that is actually an area containing a switch device that connects to the network.

There square measure variety of network firms that give the services of installation, maintenance, and support services guaranteeing sleek and efficient functioning of your systems.
