It is quite natural that you have questions regarding owning an updated & responsive website. Having a question regarding revamping your current dull and monotonous website is nothing new and as a business owner, you shouldn't be afraid to express your view. However, does a credible, user-friendly website design truly matter? Out of curiosity, you have taken a day off from your managing duty and with a hot mug of coffee, you have started searching for a website designing company who can change the website for you. However, until now you are not convinced that the investment you are about to make to enhance the user experience will create more business! Despite your skepticism, if you search a bit about " advantages of great website design", you will find out almost every single study shows a well built, well managed, aesthetically pleasing and eye candy design have a huge impact on the success of small & large businesses.

There are several explanations for why a properly designed website will attract a huge number of diverse clients to your organization. Here are most crucial three components that need to follow as a website designer while designing a website.

# Simplified navigation:
 An intuitive & user-friendly website navigation is possibly the most crucial element of a website. Today, a website can hold multiple pages and a well thought out navigation page layout will definitely make the page transition more comfortable and user-friendly. When designing a website, sometimes developer/ designers get carried away with modern design & fancy typeface. According to the researchers, simplified navigation maximizes customer return and reduces customer bounce rate. To all my fellow developer and designers I would like to request that make the websites' navigation so easy that even your grandma won't ask you for any help!

# Brand consistency:
 The brand logo is a crucial part of any business. Maybe sometimes the logo itself symbolize organizations' trustworthiness, service type, and quality. Am I bragging about a logo way too much? Let me explain! Think about those times when you are hungry, driving in the road suddenly you spot a yellow "M" sign near a gas station. Feeling even hungrier? Do you read the sign and then decide if you are having "Triple Cheeseburger" or "Sausage McGriddles"? I think you know where I am going with that now! As a designer, you need to remember that it is crucial that you carry the brand logo on every single page of the website. And always remember to use consistent font style because sometimes a font style becomes an identity of the organization! It is necessary that visitors can recognize the brand by watching a glimpse of a part of the logo itself. It's extremely significant to your visitors to be able to identify your brand in every kind of communication so they really associate your brand position and promise along with your business.

# Trust:
 Trust is one of the most crucial parts of any type of business success. It is incredibly important that you keep building trust with your visitors, although, it won't happen until you know them & their value. To build trust, you need to be transparent and you should clearly communicate with the client. Before overhauling the website, maybe you can share some new website templet with the clients and ask them for valuable feedback. In this way, your clients will feel that they matter to you and you will have the best suitable design preferred for customers itself. If you are a designer, it is important to ask the business owner about customer diversity and if the business owner doesn't know about that, ask them to do the mentioned procedure. By creating a client's preferred website, business owners will clearly enjoy the rise in website traffic and sales.

The internet can be quite a scary place for those who usually do business in an old traditional way. Promotion of a business through internet is quite challenging, however, a good website design can help to minimize risk. If a website is made and managed properly, customers will definitely come back to your online place and conduct business along with the organization.
