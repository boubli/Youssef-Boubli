Storing pharmaceutical vaccines at the right temperature and moisture levels is essential, otherwise the vaccines can become irreparably damaged. If such thing happens, those drugs can’t be used - in other words people won’t be vaccinated and a lot of money will go waste.

So, for those who are involved in the storage of vaccines or other medications, should take care of the correct storage conditions. They should keep a regular record of temperature and humidity measurements and should have a back plan always ready to keep the temperature static.

In the past there have been cases when the individuals were to be vaccinated twice because the original batch didn’t proved effective. The major reason for that has been reported as the inefficient storage that damaged the medication.

Temperature monitoring

The major problem that occurs with the vaccine storage is the maintenance of right temperatures. This problem in itself if worse but a major catastrophe can occur when the temperature monitoring and regulatory mechanism occurs faulty. In that case the storage in charge has no idea to get the temperature on relevant levels.

The storage of drugs at wrong temperatures generally doesn’t make them harmful but in majority of cases the drug looses its potency and if often made less useful. That is why the people were required to get re vaccinated when the original dose didn’t worked.

To assure that vaccines and drugs are stored under controlled conditions at right temperatures and moisture levels, there is need of right policies, practices and procedures combined with the use of correct equipment, like wireless temperature monitor or remote temperature probe. Vaccine monitoring system that measures temperature on regular basis can present a detailed log of it is really very essential.

There are a number of temperature monitoring options like there can be manual labor employed that can measure and record all temperature variations throughout the day on regular basis. But this isn’t reliable option and is subjected to several errors.

There are several technologically advanced options available like systems that are able to record temperature of cold store remotely. Users can log in from far flung areas and can view temperature logs for up-to-minute updates.

Wireless environmental monitor

Vaccines ought to be stored at precisely correct temperatures. Even with the correct container, right staff and good practices and monitoring equipment, the store should always be ready with a counter plan to keep the storage well fetched in case of failure with the existing system. A common option can be to have two monitoring systems installed so that if one shuts down the other keeps on functioning properly. That means the critical temperature is never lost.

When you are considering temperature and humidity monitor system for vaccine or drug storage it is advised to choose the right supplier with an excellent experience and a good track record in the pharmaceutical equipment supplies. They are most likely to understand your specific needs and have the most relevant equipment on offer that can allow you maintain the critical temperature for storage of drugs.
