Losing an important file is a loss that gives a lot of stress. However, you don't need to panic anymore as there are many ways to get that file back. We all have been there. You are almost done with your project and your computer crashes. Once it is up, you no longer see your file. If you want to recover your files, make sure you work carefully. Given below are a few tips that can help you get your lost data back. Read on to know more.

1. Check The Recycle Bin

This is a really important step. Make sure you do it first or you may end up wasting a lot of time for nothing. When you don't see your file in the relevant folder, the first thing you need to do is check the recycle bin. At times, we end up deleting an important file when we are working with a large pile of files. So, make sure you open up the recycle bin first. If the file is there, you can quickly restore it. Problem solved!

2. Check your Email Inbox or Cloud-Based Account

Often, multiple versions of the same files are found in the Sent folder in the email inbox. you may have sent the same files to your friends, colleagues, and family, for instance. You may also have the file on your cloud-based account.

Even if the file you have in your inbox is the older version, you won't have to start over. You can spend a few minutes to work on the file to update it. Don't forget to check your memory card either.

3. Run your Backup Program

It's a good idea to create backups of your libraries or hard drive in order to avoid losing your important business files. Usually, Windows OS comes with a backup application that can create a backup of your images and documents on a regular basis. The majority of programs can do incremental backups, which means you don't need to worry about losing your documents anymore.

4. Install a Data Recovery Program

You can choose from a lot of data recovery programs found on the Internet. They can scan your computer hard drives for lost or deleted documents. All you need to do is install one of these programs and hit the Scan button. As soon as you have completed the scan, you may get all your files back. You can search for the file by size, name or type based on your needs.

The process may take a lot of time depending upon how big your hard drives are. The recovery period also depends on the speed of your machine. Faster machines can complete the job quickly.

Long story short, if you are looking for a way to protect your data, make sure you have a computer that runs efficiently. If your computer is crashing over and over again, chances are that you will lose your files. Also, creating regular updates is also a good idea.
