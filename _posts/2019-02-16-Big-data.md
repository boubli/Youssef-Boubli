Data Science & Cybersecurity - what is big data analytics? Why is machine learning applications so important? Why did InfoSec Professionals require to learn about DS? What to know about "data bots" as a data science professional? Differences in data science vs machine learning? How to crack cybersecurity jobs with data science advantage?

DS is a multi-sided field that uses scientific techniques, methods, algorithms, and security practices to extract information and insights.

With the help of DS tools such as Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics, businesses can now get access to meaningful insights hidden within massive data-sets.

This is where DS can help create a significant and lasting impact.

DS and cybersecurity, two of the most popular career paths, are on a collision course. Very intelligent, seasoned, senior managers do not fully understand the importance, or the complexities, of DS and cybersecurity. "There's a mad rush in the cyber security solutions space to use the terms machine learning, analytics, and DS in conjunction with security products. The CERT Data Science and Cybersecurity Symposium highlighted advances in DS, reviewed government use cases, and demonstrated related tools. Applied DS for Cyber Security. In today's world, we are assailed by ever-increasing amounts of data and increasingly sophisticated attacks. The programme is designed to build students' knowledge and develop their expertise in network security, cryptography, DS, and big data analytics. The NACE Center and BHEF conducted research into two skills likely to be important in the future economy: data analytics and cybersecurity skills. A data scientist is a professional with a blend of skills in computer science, mathematics and cybersecurity domain expertise. Cyber Security is a fast-growing field in an ever-interconnected world. Learn why it matters and what data science has to do with it. Data science, along with technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, has found its way into countless security products. Leading experts in the fields of data science and cybersecurity discussing a range of topics related to the role -DS has in addressing the issues.

The section of knowledge will illustrate the inter-relationship between several data management, analytics and decision support techniques and methods commonly adopted in. With automation and AI able to pick up jobs that humans need them to, data analytics and cybersecurity might find it easier to hire skilled employees. Although machine learning tools are commonly used in numerous applications, the big boom of advanced analytics in cybersecurity is yet to come. And that will be interesting to see the future tools to cop up with. Fingers crossed.
