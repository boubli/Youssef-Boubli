Flex application development services are always based on open-source application framework that let Flex web development company build mobile, desktop and web applications easily using the same programming model, tool and code base. With the advent of Flex, the demand for Flex-centric applications has increased and clients across the globe are eager to avail the services of Flex development company in India. It is with this rich Flex application development that small businesses can have dynamic and rich websites that can improve their sales and hence profits.

In March 2004, Macromedia initially released software development kit, an IDE and a J2EE integration application which is known as Flex Data Services. However, Adobe acquired multimedia in 2005 and after that no release of Flex required a license for Flex Data Services which has then become a separate product rebranded as LiveCycle Data Services.

The ColdFusion MX 7.0.2 release has updated Flash remoting to prop up Action Script 3, a Flex Data Services event gateway, and the Flex Data Services assembler. Flex Builder 2 also adds extensions for ColdFusion providing a set of wizards for RAD Flex application development. A subset of Flex 1.5 is also embedded into ColdFusion MX 7 middleware platform, for use in the ColdFusion Flash forms feature. It is possible to use this framework to write rich internet applications, although its intended purpose is for rich forms only.
