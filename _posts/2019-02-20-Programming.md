# The Definitive Guide
Python is a powerful multi-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum.

It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time.

This is a comprehensive guide on how to get started in Python, why you should learn it and how you can learn it. However, if you knowledge of other programming languages and want to quickly get started with Python, visit Python tutorial page.

# What is Python (Programming)? - The Basics
Before getting started, lets get familiarized with the language first.

Python is a general-purpose language. It has wide range of applications from Web development (like: Django and Bottle), scientific and mathematical computing (Orange, SymPy, NumPy) to desktop graphical user Interfaces (Pygame, Panda3D).

The syntax of the language is clean and length of the code is relatively short. It's fun to work in Python because it allows you to think about the problem rather than focusing on the syntax.

# Reasons to Choose Python as First Language
* Simple Elegant Syntax
 Programming in Python is fun. It's easier to understand and write Python code. Why? The syntax feels natural. Take this source code for an example:

```python 
	a = 2
	b = 3
	sum = a + b
	print(sum)
```

Even if you have never programmed before, you can easily guess that this program adds two numbers and prints it.

* Not overly strict
You don't need to define the type of a variable in Python. Also, it's not necessary to add semicolon at the end of the statement.

Python enforces you to follow good practices (like proper indentation). These small things can make learning much easier for beginners.

* Expressiveness of the language
Python allows you to write programs having greater functionality with fewer lines of code. Here's a link to the source code of Tic-tac-toe game with a graphical interface and a 
smart computer opponent in less than 500 lines of code. This is just an example. You will be amazed how much you can do with Python once you learn the basics.
