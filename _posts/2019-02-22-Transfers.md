Working with files stored on a remote FTP server is a pain at the best of times, particularly if you're using a Web-based solution such as those provided by many hosting companies. A typical locally installed FTP client also leaves a lot to be desired, especially when it comes to the various freeware solutions. Although these tools are fine if you only very occasionally need to access, upload or download a file or two from the remote server, they quickly become impractical when you have heavy workloads to deal with. For those who need to regularly work with data stored on a remote server and rely on using the FTP protocol as part of their daily routines, the traditional solutions simply aren't adequate. FTPGetter 3 Professional ( http://www.ftpgetter.com ) was developed precisely for this reason - to automate FTP and SFTP transfers in a way that saves more time than you ever imagined possible.

Enhance Your Workflow

The traditional FTP client, whether Web-based or locally installed, tends to be slow and unresponsive, and it's the increased time needed to work with the remotely stored files that ultimately translates into decreased profitability. By automating everyday FTP tasks, you'll be able to free up valuable time to get on with other more important areas of your business routines, such as those that cannot be automated. When you consider the entire process of adding, downloading or checking just a single file using the conventional method, you can quickly see how cumbersome it gets when you must do this regularly throughout the day. By automating the process, you'll be in a much better position to both save time and significantly reduce the risk of human error.

FTPGetter 3 Professional doesn't just make working with files stored on the remote server easier; it also provides a full range of automation tools allowing you to schedule tasks and leave it to do the hard work for you. The built-in scheduling feature allows you to configure specific tasks using a simple and intuitive wizard-based interface. For example, you can set up a task that automatically checks for new file creations or updates once per day and synchronizes them with those stored locally. This function is ideal, for example, for keeping your remotely stored content safely backed up in your business premises. After all, you can never be too careful given the ever-increasing risk of a data breach wreaking havoc for your business.

Advanced Features

FTPGetter 3 Professional provides a range of advanced tools and features that are nonetheless easy to use and instantly familiar to anyone who has used a conventional FTP client before. It also supports file masks, allowing you to tell the program to only pay attention to files with certain extensions. It can also synchronize entire directories between the local computer and the remote server, ensuring that all data is kept current at all times. At the same time, the automated process completely negates the risk of human error, consequently keeping your data safer. Ultimately, if you're looking for an easy-to-use solution that can save enormous amounts of time, then FTPGetter 3 Professional offers exactly what you need.
