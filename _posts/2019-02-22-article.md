Article spinning is similar to rewriting articles unless it's partially (or fully) automatic. An article spinner takes your articles, sees and matches the words in them with words in the synonym library. They then enter these synonyms in your article as an alternative to matching words. After you click the play button, the tool will pass through your article and one by one randomly replace the words that match one of the alternatives. Then save new articles and start again with the original until you have created many unique articles that you need - 50, 100, 250 etc. Spinners can also replace phrases and sentences with alternatives that you write to make the article even more unique.

There are times when you need to recreate articles that you have previously written using words, terms, phrases, sentences, etc. Different so that the new article conveys exactly the same meaning to the reader as the original.

Website writers looking for traffic often rewrite articles to get more links to their website. To understand this, you need to understand a little about how the Internet works. The more visitors your website receives, the higher the number who will click on the ad on your website or buy goods from you. Also the closer to the top of your website's search results come to the terms (keywords) people search on the Internet, the more traffic you will receive. Many search engines calculate the popularity of a site by calculating how many sites link to it and in turn how popular the site is if your site is linked to sites that have lots of links that lead to it, you get more credit. Therefore, the more websites you can persuade to link to your site, the better your site will be positioned in the search engine results. You can increase the ranking of your website by distributing articles (called article marketing) to the web for other people to use as free content on their sites and blogs. An important part of this as far as search engines are concerned is that this article almost always includes a profile section at the end that contains links that point to your website. In some cases you are also permitted to have similar links in the article itself so that after your article is republished on the site, they link to your site.

Using article marketing, you can get hundreds of links to point to your website by creating one article. But the effect is not as strong as you might expect because search engines and Google in particular will demean, or reduce the number of links that point to your website if they detect that everything comes from the same article that was published and republished many times. To overcome this effect you can rewrite or rotate your article to create hundreds of unique ones so that you get the full benefits of generating links.

Different tools rotate in different ways - some others are manually classified as automatic. Automatically rotating your articles involves your spinner choosing the synonyms entered in your article for you. Manual spinning of articles on the other hand is under your control. In manual spinning you decide exactly which synonyms are inserted in your article so that your last article makes sense. You may not use an automatic spinner because it almost always produces very bad and unreasonable grammar.

One way to get more unique articles is by combining your article rewriting by playing it. There are also article spinners that help with the distribution process so you don't have to do it manually (which is a very time-consuming task).

The main advantage of article rewriting and spinning is that it helps you create articles that take months to make. It also helps you generate links and potential traffic to your website very quickly. In addition, you can also benefit from referrals as visitors to the site where your article is republished are sometimes quite interesting to click on the link in the article and visit your site. While search engines like unique articles, spinning now depends on the fact that search engines are not advanced enough to understand the meaning of sentences, but can only find out if they contain the same words. If they finally advance to the point where they can compare the meaning of two different written sentences and say it is identical, then publishing a rotating article to create a website link can be excessive.

There are various types of spinners and rewriters including those that you must install on your computer and online services. Some types combine spinners and rewriters together so you can get the best in unique articles.

You have to completely avoid using automatic spinners because they often distort your original sentence completely so that it ends up saying things that don't make sense at all eg Word files can mean registering, smoothing or recording so that the phrase "can you submit this letter?" can end as "can you tidy up this letter?" which is meaningless - unless someone sits on it because of a mistake!

Summary: The combination of articles that spin and rewrite together with publishing unique articles is one of the best ways to generate links, and get more traffic for your website. Attracting more traffic to your site will in turn increase your sales and advertising revenue.
