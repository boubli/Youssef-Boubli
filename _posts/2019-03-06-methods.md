There are a range of methods that can be utilised to build backlinks for any website, some of which are useful and some of which are not. Some of the links that will be built will be quality ones and some will not be. Some will work better than others.

The massing of backlinks for any website is a very fundamental part of SEO and SEM. Most people think that all that is necessary is to write amazing article content to have the links pour in. This is certainly true to a certain extent, but sadly for many writing marvellous content is rather easier said than done. Quintessential in all of this, however, is to have excellent anchor text within your web pages as a means of helping search engines to recognise what your site content is all about. Here are some methods that work.

Article Writing The more people write articles to backlink their websites, the more satisfaction they will derive from it, as its so easy. Of course, all the articles you write may not be published and often people will ask themselves what they could have been thinking about when they look at articles they wrote some time ago. Nonetheless, it is very rewarding to see your articles syndicated and you will have the benefit of abundant backlinks and be branding yourself at the same time. Therefore, article writing is essential.

Blogs You can have a great deal of success with this on a comparison with article writing, but its something that you have to discover how to do. If you are just starting out, having your blog approved can be somewhat unpredictable. Nonetheless, if you discover a blog that links out via comments and does not apply a no follow attribute to your link, then bookmark it. Then visit that blog with regularity, leaving relevant comments. Within a short period of time, you will be able to build up a huge list of blogs that link out.

Guest Blogs This is very similar to article marketing. The drawback to guest blogging however is that the guest post will almost never be syndicated. Nonetheless, a guest post on a good blog could really help to steer traffic your way. Furthermore, links from strong blogs can assist with both your page rank and trust rank. Article marketing is a good way to train for blog posting.

Profile Links and Forum Signatures There can be mixed results from the use of these and they are often misunderstood. It has to be borne in mind that the quality of the way you link using this method will be reflected in the quality and level of trust that the forum maintains with the search engines. If you engineer a large number of profile links, this can be a successful way of gaining trust and authority with the search engines. A good contributor in a forum will drive traffic to their site via visits to their profile page and signature links.

Building links is a protracted process, but you will benefit if you persevere. The benefits in the long term are gaining a good page rank and earning trust, as well as hopefully making money for your business.
