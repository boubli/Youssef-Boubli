When driving the vehicle to work or to any other destination, we can rely on the use of an application on the vehicle's dash panel or at least on our smartphone to guide us through the best way to reach to the place of our choice, we can select options such as avoiding tolls or highways should we chose to elect so, and then all we have to do is just follow the guidance of the voice from the application. Impressive! Just like that; there are more applications than we can count-on for a diversity of related services to help us on our daily activities.

Now imagine driving on your vehicle away from home to a destination far away for your next vacation. Having an application guiding your journey and at the same time as you drive, checking on your vehicle fuel tank level and notifying you for the closest gas-station with the lowest prices of your preferred octane rating for your vehicle on your way forward if needed to, ensuring there is enough gas in the tank to reach to your destination; having the same application checking continuously on your tire pressure and general vehicle's health, and providing alerts such any of these issues requires attention.

While driving long hours on your trip, imagine the application providing options for you on food and lodging based on your preferences such as price range, bed and amenities preferences', or for vegetarian, Mexican or Italian restaurants in the area, and providing you with the best of all options. All you have to do is just to speak out or touch on the screen the option of your choice and the application will complete the reservation for you and/or guide you through the new stop on you way.

How far in the future?

Some of these features we are enjoying today, but there are other ones which pretty soon will be available, it is a trend destined to grow exponentially, it will include many if not all of our imaginable needs on a daily basis. All of these interactions is what it is being called Internet of Things, it certainly is not longer a thing to take place in the future rather a reality of our present day, and it is expanding rather fast.

Why is it important?

Just like the Internet is here to connect people, the Internet of Things is here to connect devices which can now interact with other bunch of them, it is estimated that since 2008 there are more devices connected to the internet than people. It is easy to assume and understand then why of the importance of the Internet of Things and why should we care to know about and get use to it as an integral part of our lives.

The Internet of Things is aimed to facilitate our daily activities and tasks by taking over some basic decisions on our behalf, where there is a network of devices connecting to the internet in order to take away from us repetitive actions or to complete tasks by learning from our condition and preferences. Those futuristic self-driving cars we watch on movies are closer than ever to be a reality, let's get comfy and watch for more as it comes available.

True is, the IoT has just born, there is plenty for all parties to learn and develop in order to make it grow in a structured and efficient way. For it to be fully realizable, its development needs to be thought to allow a connection among devices to be easiable, a plug-n-play concept.
