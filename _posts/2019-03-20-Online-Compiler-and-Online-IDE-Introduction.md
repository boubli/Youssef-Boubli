Organizing your programming projects is a difficult task, when you consider that your code may be stored at a variety of different locations, and on any number of different computers - this is particularly true when you work in teams on your programming projects. When you have your project stored on a single computer at a single location, that computer becomes your ball and chain, and you find yourself running back to that single computer anytime you need to tweak your code, update a project, or bring your local files in line with your team members. This last aspect is particularly troublesome, as each member of the team will often have their own version of the code stored locally on their computer, creating unnecessary distractions for your team and project delays. These are real problems for just about every programming team, and are the problems which online compilers have made it their mission to solve.

When you use an online IDE (a.k.a. an online compiler), you store your code in the cloud. This permits you and your team the freedom to access and edit your code from any web browser; you and your team edit the exact same files, whether you are using the same local machine or not, keeping your projects organized and your teamwork streamlined. With the ability to browse shared files, just as if these files were stored locally on your computer; your team can work on a project with one, unified set of code.

By making the move to an online compiler you and your team can:

Program on the Move
When you use an online IDE, the only thing you need to edit your code is a web browser and an internet connection. Have you ever imagined editing your code from an internet cafe, or even a new friend's computer while backpacking Europe? Well, now you can. With an online IDE, for the first time you can program without being tied down to the code on your hard drive.

Work as a Unified Team
Teamwork just isn't the same if every member of the team is disconnected from the actions of one another. You need to keep your code organized, and you need all team members to constantly be working with the latest version of your project, so that they can quickly and easily build upon alternations made by their fellow team members. With an online compiler, all team members can simultaneously access and edit the exact same code, while browsing a project's files in the exact same way they would were the files stored on their local computer, keeping your entire team effective and on-task.

Projects in Minutes
Out of the box, an online IDE comes pre-packaged with just about everything a skillful programmer's heart desires. All the libraries, languages, and other elements needed to get a project up and running are pre-installed and ready to go, allow you to get a new project up and running in just minutes, without having to run through the steps of installing the components your project will depend on.

Code for Any System
For many coders, they cannot afford to have a Mac, Linux, and Windows computer as well as any number of mobile devices. For those who can afford it, it is an expense that many of us could do without. With an online compiler, you don't need a quiver of computers, and a storage box of mobile devices. You can program for Mac, Windows, and Linux, or even mobile devices, without the need to purchase the extra hardware needed to run your code.

Code on New Devices
Today, there is a browser on your computer and your Smartphone, and we're pretty certain that within the year your microwave might just have one too. With the ability to log in and edit your code from almost any web browser, you can access your code with just about any web-capable device as well. When a client or a member of your team needs changes to your code on short notice, logging in with your Smartphone can be a lifesaver, allowing you more flexibility in when, where, and how to edit your code than ever before.

Online IDE's are changing the way we programmers manage projects, work in a team, and most of all, are giving us the flexibility to leave our computer's ball and chain behind. You can use an online compiler or online compiler as anything from an online c compiler to a VB editor, and it's changing the way we work. When you store and compile your code in the cloud, you enjoy a freedom and flexibility that our coding forefathers could only dream of. Now, live the dream coding pioneers worked so hard for, and make the switch to an online IDE - trust me, you won't regret it.
